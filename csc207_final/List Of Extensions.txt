===[List of Extensions]===

# Note: Our group has only 7 members. Though it shows we have 8 members on MarkUs, there is one member that never
show up. So we chose 3 optional extensions.

1. Mandatory extensions
    (a) Multiple types of events: Includes normal event (1 speaker), panel (2 speakers), and party (no speakers).
    (b) Events can be canceled by at least one organizer.
    (c) VIP user:
        - special code required to create VIP accounts, from a perfect score in a math game's hard mode
        - can message any organizer, also VIPs or attendees if they're friends
        - custom UI (slightly nicer)
    (d) Organizers can create other users including: Attendee, Speaker, and VIP.
    (e) Events and Rooms have maximum capacity.
2. Optional extensions
    (a) Enhance the user's messaging experience by allowing them to "mark as unread",
    delete, or archive messages after reading them.
        -Organizers can view message garbage bin--messages deleted from both sender and receiver
        inboxes--and clear it.
    (b) Allows user to request events by a specific day, time or speaker,and requested events. For speakers,
    they can also see events that they speaks.
    (c) Separate Room as an Entity from Event. Each Room class contains information about room capacity, square footage,

        - Delete a room.
3. Our own extensions
